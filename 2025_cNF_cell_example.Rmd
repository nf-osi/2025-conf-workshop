# Welcome to the NF Data Portal Workshop!

In this workshop, we'll explore gene expression data from the NF Data Portal, 
comparing immortalized cutaneous neurofibroma (cNF) cell lines with primary 
cutaneous neurofibroma cells. This analysis will help us understand how 
immortalization affects gene expression and what this means for using cell 
lines as research models.

## Background: Why Compare Immortalized vs Primary Cells?

**Cell Culture Models in Research:**
Scientists often use immortalized cell lines because they:
- Grow indefinitely in culture
- Provide consistent, reproducible results
- Are easier to manipulate experimentally
- Can be shared between laboratories

However, immortalization involves genetic changes that may alter cellular behavior.

**Primary vs Immortalized Cells:**

**Primary Cells:**
- Directly isolated from patient tumors
- Maintain characteristics closest to original tumor
- Have limited lifespan in culture (undergo senescence)
- More variable between experiments
- Represent the "gold standard" for tumor biology

**Immortalized Cell Lines:**
- Genetically modified to bypass senescence
- Can divide indefinitely
- More consistent experimental results
- May have altered gene expression patterns due to immortalization process

**Why This Comparison Matters:**
- Validates whether cell lines preserve key tumor characteristics
- Identifies genes/pathways altered by immortalization process
- Helps interpret results from cell line studies
- Guides selection of appropriate model systems

## What we'll learn:
- How to access data from the NF Data Portal using Synapse
- Basic differential expression analysis in R
- Gene set enrichment analysis to understand biological pathways
- Data visualization techniques for genomics data
- How immortalization affects cellular gene expression

**Expected time: 40 minutes**

## 1. Setup and Package Installation (5 minutes)

We'll start by installing the essential R packages needed for our analysis. 
We're keeping this minimal to save time - just the core tools for data access, 
statistical analysis, and visualization.

```{r setup, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Install required packages (only run once)
if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) {
    install.packages("BiocManager")
}

# List of packages we need
packages <- c(
    "synapser",      # Already installed - for accessing Synapse data
    "dplyr",         # Data manipulation
    "ggplot2",       # Plotting
    "readr",         # Reading files
    "DESeq2",        # Differential expression analysis
    "pheatmap",      # Heatmaps
    "enrichR"        # Gene set enrichment
)

# Install missing packages
new_packages <- packages[!(packages %in% installed.packages()[,"Package"])]
if(length(new_packages)) {
    if("DESeq2" %in% new_packages) {
        BiocManager::install("DESeq2")
        new_packages <- new_packages[new_packages != "DESeq2"]
    }
    if(length(new_packages) > 0) {
        install.packages(new_packages)
    }
}

# Load all packages
library(synapser)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(readr)
library(DESeq2)
library(pheatmap)
library(enrichR)

cat("Packages loaded successfully!\n")
```

## 2. Login to Synapse and Download Data (5 minutes)

**About Synapse and the NF Data Portal:**
The NF Data Portal (nf.synapse.org) is built on Synapse, a collaborative 
platform for sharing research data. It contains RNA-seq, genomics, and clinical 
data from NF studies worldwide.

**Our datasets:** 
- **syn29654184:** Sample metadata with clinical information
- **syn29532377:** Pre-computed gene counts matrix (saves significant time!)

```{r synapse_login}
# Login to Synapse (you'll need a personal access token or .synapseConfig file, please go back to the main workshop doc)
synLogin()

# Our dataset IDs from the NF Data Portal
metadata_id <- "syn29654184"  # Sample metadata
counts_id <- "syn29532377"    # Gene counts matrix

cat("Downloading datasets from NF Data Portal...\n")
```

```{r download_data}
# Download sample metadata
cat("Downloading sample metadata...\n")
metadata_query <- synTableQuery(paste("SELECT * FROM", metadata_id))
metadata <- read.csv(metadata_query$filepath, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Download gene counts matrix (TSV format)
cat("Downloading gene counts matrix...\n")
counts_file <- synGet(counts_id)
counts_data <- read_tsv(counts_file$path, show_col_types = FALSE)

# Convert to matrix format with gene names as row names
counts_matrix <- as.matrix(counts_data[, -c(1,2)])  # Remove gene_id and gene_name columns
rownames(counts_matrix) <- counts_data$gene_name
colnames(counts_matrix) <- colnames(counts_data)[-c(1,2)]

cat("Data download complete!\n")
cat("Metadata:", nrow(metadata), "samples\n")
cat("Counts matrix:", nrow(counts_matrix), "genes x", ncol(counts_matrix), "samples\n")

# Show available samples in counts matrix
cat("\nSample names in counts matrix:\n")
print(colnames(counts_matrix))
```

---

## 3. Identify and Match cNF Samples (5 minutes)

**Sample selection strategy:** We'll focus only on cutaneous neurofibroma (cNF) 
samples and compare primary cells (directly from tumors) to immortalized cell 
lines (genetically modified for indefinite growth).

**Cell naming patterns:**
- **Primary cNF:** cNF97.2a, cNF00.10a (start with 'cNF', no 'i' prefix)
- **Immortalized cNF:** icNF97.2a, i28cNF (start with 'i')

```{r identify_samples}
# Examine the metadata structure
cat("Tumor types in metadata:\n")
table(metadata$tumorType, useNA = "ifany")

# Filter for cutaneous neurofibroma samples only and categorize by cell origin
cnf_samples <- metadata %>%
    filter(tumorType == "Cutaneous Neurofibroma") %>%
    mutate(
        cell_origin = case_when(
            grepl("^i", modelSystemName) ~ "Immortalized",
            grepl("^cNF", modelSystemName) | grepl("^28cNF", modelSystemName) ~ "Primary",
            TRUE ~ "Other"
        )
    ) %>%
    filter(cell_origin %in% c("Primary", "Immortalized"))

cat("\ncNF samples by cell origin:\n")
table(cnf_samples$cell_origin)

cat("\nSample details:\n")
cnf_samples %>%
    select(modelSystemName, cell_origin, individualID, age, sex) %>%
    arrange(cell_origin, modelSystemName) %>%
    print()
```

```{r match_sample_names}
# Create mapping between metadata names and counts matrix column names
# Most cNF samples should match directly, but we'll check systematically

create_sample_mapping <- function(metadata_names, counts_colnames) {
    mapping <- data.frame(
        metadata_name = metadata_names,
        counts_name = NA_character_,
        stringsAsFactors = FALSE
    )
    
    for(i in seq_along(metadata_names)) {
        meta_name <- metadata_names[i]
        
        # For most cNF samples, names should match directly
        potential_name <- meta_name
        
        # Check if this name exists in counts matrix
        if(potential_name %in% counts_colnames) {
            mapping$counts_name[i] <- potential_name
        }
    }
    
    return(mapping)
}

# Create the mapping
sample_mapping <- create_sample_mapping(
    cnf_samples$modelSystemName,
    colnames(counts_matrix)
)

# Add mapping info to metadata
cnf_samples$counts_name <- sample_mapping$counts_name

# Filter to successfully mapped samples
matched_samples <- cnf_samples %>%
    filter(!is.na(counts_name))

cat("\nSuccessful sample mappings:\n")
mapping_table <- matched_samples %>%
    select(modelSystemName, counts_name, cell_origin, individualID) %>%
    arrange(cell_origin)
print(mapping_table)

cat("\nFinal sample counts:\n")
table(matched_samples$cell_origin)
```

```{r prepare_final_data}
# Create final datasets for analysis
final_sample_names <- matched_samples$counts_name
final_counts <- counts_matrix[, final_sample_names]
final_metadata <- matched_samples %>%
    arrange(match(counts_name, colnames(final_counts)))

# Verify sample order matches
stopifnot(all(final_metadata$counts_name == colnames(final_counts)))

cat("Final dataset prepared:\n")
cat("Genes:", nrow(final_counts), "\n")
cat("Samples:", ncol(final_counts), "\n")
cat("Primary cNF samples:", sum(final_metadata$cell_origin == "Primary"), "\n")
cat("Immortalized cNF samples:", sum(final_metadata$cell_origin == "Immortalized"), "\n")
```

## 4. Data Quality Control and Visualization (8 minutes)

**Why quality control matters:**
Before analysis, we need to ensure our data is high quality. We'll filter out 
genes with very low expression and examine overall data patterns.

**Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** This reduces the complexity of our data 
down to the major patterns of variation. If immortalization significantly 
affects gene expression, we should see separation between primary and 
immortalized samples in PCA space.

```{r quality_control}
# Filter genes with low expression
# Keep genes with at least 10 counts in at least 25% of samples
min_samples <- ceiling(ncol(final_counts) * 0.25)
keep_genes <- rowSums(final_counts >= 10) >= min_samples
filtered_counts <- final_counts[keep_genes, ]

cat("Gene filtering results:\n")
cat("Genes before filtering:", nrow(final_counts), "\n")
cat("Genes after filtering:", nrow(filtered_counts), "\n")
cat("Genes removed:", sum(!keep_genes), "\n")

# Convert counts to integers (round to nearest integer)
# NOTE: This is a bit of a hack for the purposes of completing the exercise 
# within the time of the workshop. In reality, we'd prefer to import quant.sf 
# files and use the tximport package, which will provide the best input for 
# DESeq2, but it takes a bit longer and requires more installation.
filtered_counts <- round(filtered_counts)

# Ensure the data is a matrix of integers
filtered_counts <- as.matrix(filtered_counts)
storage.mode(filtered_counts) <- "integer"

# Create DESeq2 object for normalization
dds_temp <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(
    countData = filtered_counts,
    colData = final_metadata,
    design = ~ cell_origin
)

# Apply variance stabilizing transformation for visualization
vst_data <- vst(dds_temp, blind = TRUE)
vst_matrix <- assay(vst_data)

cat("Data normalized for visualization\n")
```

```{r visualize_quality}
# 1. Library size distribution
library_sizes <- colSums(filtered_counts)
lib_df <- data.frame(
    sample = final_metadata$counts_name,
    library_size = library_sizes / 1e6,  # Convert to millions
    cell_origin = final_metadata$cell_origin,
    individual = final_metadata$individualID
)

p1 <- ggplot(lib_df, aes(x = sample, y = library_size, fill = cell_origin)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
    theme_minimal() +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, size = 8)) +
    labs(title = "Library Sizes by Sample", 
         x = "Sample", y = "Total Counts (Millions)", fill = "Cell Origin") +
    scale_fill_manual(values = c("Primary" = "lightgreen", "Immortalized" = "orange"))

print(p1)

# 2. Principal Component Analysis
pca_result <- prcomp(t(vst_matrix), scale. = FALSE)

pca_df <- data.frame(
    PC1 = pca_result$x[,1],
    PC2 = pca_result$x[,2],
    sample = final_metadata$counts_name,
    cell_origin = final_metadata$cell_origin,
    individual = final_metadata$specimenID
)

# Calculate variance explained
var_explained <- round(summary(pca_result)$importance[2,] * 100, 1)

p2 <- ggplot(pca_df, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = cell_origin)) +
    geom_point(size = 4) +
    geom_text(aes(label = individual), vjust = 1.5, size = 3) +
    theme_minimal() +
    labs(title = "Principal Component Analysis: Primary vs Immortalized cNF",
         x = paste0("PC1 (", var_explained[1], "% variance)"),
         y = paste0("PC2 (", var_explained[2], "% variance)"),
         color = "Cell Origin") +
    scale_color_manual(values = c("Primary" = "darkgreen", "Immortalized" = "darkorange"))

print(p2)
```

**Interpreting the plots:**
- **Library sizes:** Should be relatively similar across samples
- **PCA plot:** Look for separation between green (Primary) and orange 
  (Immortalized) points, which would indicate that immortalization has a 
  significant impact on gene expression patterns

## 5. Differential Expression Analysis: Immortalized vs Primary (12 minutes)

**The core question:** Which genes are expressed differently between immortalized 
and primary cutaneous neurofibroma cells? These differences will help us 
understand:
- How immortalization affects cellular gene expression
- Which pathways are altered by the immortalization process
- How to interpret results from cell line studies

**Statistical approach - DESeq2:**
DESeq2 is the gold standard for RNA-seq analysis. It properly models count data 
and controls for multiple testing across thousands of genes.

```{r differential_expression}
# Create DESeq2 dataset
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(
    countData = filtered_counts,
    colData = final_metadata,
    design = ~ cell_origin
)

# Set reference level (Primary as reference, so positive fold changes = higher in Immortalized)
dds$cell_origin <- relevel(dds$cell_origin, ref = "Primary")

cat("Running differential expression analysis...\n")
cat("Dataset:", nrow(dds), "genes x", ncol(dds), "samples\n")

# Run DESeq2 analysis
dds <- DESeq(dds)

# Extract results
results <- results(dds, contrast = c("cell_origin", "Immortalized", "Primary"))

# Summarize results
summary(results)
```

```{r process_results}
# Convert results to data frame
results_df <- data.frame(results) %>%
    tibble::rownames_to_column("gene_symbol") %>%
    mutate(
        significant = padj < 0.05 & abs(log2FoldChange) > 1,
        direction = case_when(
            log2FoldChange > 1 & padj < 0.05 ~ "Higher in Immortalized",
            log2FoldChange < -1 & padj < 0.05 ~ "Higher in Primary",
            TRUE ~ "Not significant"
        )
    ) %>%
    arrange(padj)

# Count significant genes
sig_up <- sum(results_df$log2FoldChange > 1 & results_df$padj < 0.05, na.rm = TRUE)
sig_down <- sum(results_df$log2FoldChange < -1 & results_df$padj < 0.05, na.rm = TRUE)

cat("\nDifferentially expressed genes (|fold change| > 1, padj < 0.05):\n")
cat("Higher in Immortalized:", sig_up, "\n")
cat("Higher in Primary:", sig_down, "\n")
cat("Total significant:", sig_up + sig_down, "\n")
```

```{r visualize_results}
# Create volcano plot
volcano_df <- results_df %>%
    filter(!is.na(padj)) %>%
    mutate(
        neg_log_padj = -log10(padj),
        color = factor(direction, levels = c("Higher in Immortalized", "Higher in Primary", "Not significant"))
    )

p3 <- ggplot(volcano_df, aes(x = log2FoldChange, y = neg_log_padj, color = color)) +
    geom_point(alpha = 0.6, size = 1) +
    theme_minimal() +
    labs(title = "Volcano Plot: Immortalized vs Primary cNF Cells",
         x = "Log2 Fold Change (Immortalized vs Primary)",
         y = "-Log10 Adjusted P-value",
         color = "Expression Pattern") +
    scale_color_manual(values = c("Higher in Immortalized" = "orange", 
                                  "Higher in Primary" = "green", 
                                  "Not significant" = "gray")) +
    geom_hline(yintercept = -log10(0.05), linetype = "dashed", alpha = 0.5) +
    geom_vline(xintercept = c(-1, 1), linetype = "dashed", alpha = 0.5) +
    theme(legend.position = "bottom")

print(p3)

# Show top differentially expressed genes
if(sig_up > 0) {
    cat("\nTop 10 genes higher in immortalized cells:\n")
    top_immortalized <- results_df %>%
        filter(log2FoldChange > 1, padj < 0.05) %>%
        head(10) %>%
        select(gene_symbol, log2FoldChange, padj)
    print(top_immortalized)
}

if(sig_down > 0) {
    cat("\nTop 10 genes higher in primary cells:\n")
    top_primary <- results_df %>%
        filter(log2FoldChange < -1, padj < 0.05) %>%
        head(10) %>%
        select(gene_symbol, log2FoldChange, padj)
    print(top_primary)
}
```

**Understanding the results:**
- **Volcano plot:** X-axis shows magnitude of change, Y-axis shows statistical confidence
- **Orange dots:** Genes higher in immortalized cells
- **Green dots:** Genes higher in primary cells
- **Thresholds:** Adjusted p-value < 0.05 and |fold change| > 1

Surprise! TERT, which was part of the protocol used to immortalize the cell lines, is the most differentially expressed gene! There are also not a huge amount of differentially expressed genes as you'll see in the next section - in this case, it's a good thing, as it means the immortalized cells have perhaps fewer differences than their primary counterparts. 

---

## 6. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (10 minutes)

**From genes to biology:** We'll test whether our differentially expressed genes 
are enriched in known biological pathways to understand how immortalization 
affects cellular processes.

**Expected findings:** Immortalized cells might show enrichment in pathways related to:
- Cell cycle progression and proliferation
- Bypass of senescence mechanisms
- DNA damage response alterations
- Metabolic reprogramming for rapid growth

```{r gene_set_enrichment}
# Define enrichment databases to test
# These are some of the most commonly used gene set databases
dbs <- c("")

# To explore other available databases, you can run
# listEnrichrDbs() or look here: https://maayanlab.cloud/Enrichr/#libraries

# Prepare gene lists for enrichment analysis
immortalized_genes <- results_df %>%
    filter(log2FoldChange > 1, padj < 0.05) %>%
    pull(gene_symbol)

primary_genes <- results_df %>%
    filter(log2FoldChange < -1, padj < 0.05) %>%
    pull(gene_symbol)

cat("Genes for enrichment analysis:\n")

if(length(immortalized_genes) > 2) {
    cat("\nRunning enrichment analysis for immortalized-enriched genes...\n")
    cat("Genes being tested:", paste(head(immortalized_genes), collapse = ", "), "...\n")
    
    enrichment_results$immortalized <- enrichr(immortalized_genes, dbs)
    # Wait to avoid enrichR caching issues (see: https://github.com/wjawaid/enrichR/issues/63)
    Sys.sleep(5)
    
    # Find the first database with significant results for display
    for(db_name in names(enrichment_results$immortalized)) {
        if(nrow(enrichment_results$immortalized[[db_name]]) > 0) {
            significant_results_imm <- enrichment_results$immortalized[[db_name]] %>%

                    select(Term, Overlap, P.value, Adjusted.P.value)
                print(top_results_immortalized)
                break
            }
        }
    }
    
    if(is.null(top_results_immortalized)) {
        cat("No significantly enriched pathways found for immortalized genes\n")
    }
} else {
    cat("Too few immortalized genes for enrichment analysis (need >2, have", length(immortalized_genes), ")\n")

            if(nrow(significant_results_prim) > 0) {
                cat(paste("\nTop pathways enriched in primary cells (", db_name, "):\n"))
                top_results_primary <- significant_results_prim %>%

                    select(Term, Overlap, P.value, Adjusted.P.value)
                print(top_results_primary)
                break
            }
        }
    }
    
    if(is.null(top_results_primary)) {
        cat("No significantly enriched pathways found for primary genes\n")
    }
} else {

# Suggestion for further exploration

```

**Understanding enrichment results:**
- **Term:** The biological process or pathway name
- **Overlap:** How many of our genes are in this pathway
- **Adjusted P-value:** Statistical significance after multiple testing correction

**Interpreting immortalization effects:**
Look for pathways that might explain how immortalized cells differ from primary cells:
- **Cell cycle pathways:** Higher in immortalized cells (bypass senescence)
- **DNA damage response:** May be altered to allow continued division
- **Metabolic pathways:** Reprogrammed to support rapid growth
- **Differentiation pathways:** May be suppressed in immortalized cells

## Summary and Interpretation

**What we discovered today:**

1. **Successful Data Access:** We efficiently accessed real research data from 
   the NF Data Portal and learned to work with both primary and immortalized 
   cell samples.

2. **Immortalization Effects:** Our analysis revealed the extent to which 
   immortalization alters gene expression in cutaneous neurofibroma cells.

3. **Pathway Insights:** We identified biological processes that are most 
   affected by the immortalization procedure.

4. **Model System Validation:** These results help us understand how well 
   immortalized cell lines represent primary tumor characteristics.

**Clinical and Research Relevance:**

**For Researchers:**
- **Model selection:** Understanding which processes are preserved vs altered 
  in cell lines helps choose appropriate experimental systems
- **Result interpretation:** Knowing immortalization effects helps distinguish 
  tumor biology from culture artifacts
- **Experimental design:** Results guide which experiments are best done in 
  primary cells vs cell lines

**For Drug Discovery:**
- **Target validation:** Some targets may behave differently in immortalized 
  vs primary cells
- **Screening strategies:** Understanding model limitations improves drug 
  screening approaches
- **Clinical translation:** Results help predict which cell line findings 
  will translate to patients

**Expected Findings:**
Based on known immortalization mechanisms, we might expect:
- **Higher in immortalized cells:** Cell cycle genes, proliferation pathways, 
  metabolic reprogramming
- **Higher in primary cells:** Differentiation markers, senescence pathways, 
  tissue-specific functions

**Implications for NF Research:**
- **Tumor biology studies:** Use primary cells when studying differentiation, 
  senescence, or tissue-specific processes
- **Drug screening:** Cell lines may be appropriate for proliferation/survival 
  pathways but less so for differentiation studies
- **Biomarker discovery:** Validate cell line findings in primary tissue samples

**Next Steps:**
- Compare your results with published immortalization studies
- Investigate specific pathways of interest in more detail
- Consider how these findings impact interpretation of cell line experiments
- Explore additional NF Data Portal datasets to validate findings
